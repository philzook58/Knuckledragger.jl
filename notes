There isn't much reason to rebuild the library entirely in Julia so far as I know, as intercommunication with Z3 is at it's core and a performance bottleneck, and the julia bindings to z3 are not as feature rich as the python ones.

The increased capability of metaprogramming and multiple dispatch in Julia may open up some interesting designs.

Perhaps high perfromance theorme proving code can be written.

Julia has an interesting community of people and applications. Open to new ideas.
